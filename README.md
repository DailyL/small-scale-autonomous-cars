This repository collects and summarizes recent research, toolkits, and hardware approaches for autonomy on small-scale cars (e.g., 1/10‚Äì1/5 scale platforms, micro‚ÄëUAV‚Äësized ground vehicles, and robotics education platforms). It covers perception, localization, planning, control, simulation, and representative datasets, with links to code and notable papers. The goal is to provide a practical resource for researchers, students, and hobbyists who want to prototype and evaluate autonomy on physically small vehicles.
