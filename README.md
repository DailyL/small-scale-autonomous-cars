# <p align="center"> **Autonomous Driving Small-Scale Cars** </p> 


## About this repository

This repository collects and summarizes recent research, toolkits, and hardware approaches for autonomy on small-scale cars (e.g., 1/10–1/5 scale platforms, micro‑UAV‑sized ground vehicles, and robotics education platforms). It covers perception, localization, planning, control, simulation, and representative datasets, with links to code and notable papers. The goal is to provide a practical resource for researchers, students, and hobbyists who want to prototype and evaluate autonomy on physically small vehicles.

## What you'll find here

* A concise literature survey and annotated bibliography of recent papers and projects.
* A comparison of common small‑scale platforms (hardware, sensors, compute).
* Recommended datasets and simulators for development and benchmarking.
* Example code snippets and pointers to open-source implementations (perception, planning, control).
* Suggested experiment recipes and evaluation metrics for reproducible research.

## Quick start

1. Clone this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/smallscale-autonomous-cars.git
cd smallscale-autonomous-cars
```

2. Browse `survey/` for the annotated bibliography and `platforms/` for hardware summaries.
3. See `examples/` for runnable demos and setup instructions.
