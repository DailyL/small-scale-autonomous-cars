This repository collects and summarizes recent research, toolkits, and hardware approaches for autonomy on small-scale cars (e.g., 1/10‚Äì1/5 scale platforms, micro‚ÄëUAV‚Äësized ground vehicles, and robotics education platforms). It covers perception, localization, planning, control, simulation, and representative datasets, with links to code and notable papers. The goal is to provide a practical resource for researchers, students, and hobbyists who want to prototype and evaluate autonomy on physically small vehicles.

## üéØ Motivation

* A concise literature survey and annotated bibliography of recent papers and projects.
* A comparison of common small‚Äëscale platforms (hardware, sensors, compute).
* Recommended datasets and simulators for development and benchmarking.
* Example code snippets and pointers to open-source implementations (perception, planning, control).
* Suggested experiment recipes and evaluation metrics for reproducible research.

*Figure 1: Illustration of the development and current states of small-scale car platforms, each depicted platform image sourced from its respective paper or website. (A) Based on published studies each year on Google Scholar with the search terms: "small-scale car" or "robot car", the research on small-scale cars has seen substantial growth in the number of papers over the years. In the early 2000s, projects like s-bot, e-puck, and TurtleBot emerged. Starting around 2016, with the introduction of Duckietown, BARC, and Autorally, there was a significant increase in research papers. This trend continued with the development of projects like DeepRacer, Donkeycar, and F1TENTH. More computationally advanced small-scale cars have been introduced in recent years, such as ART/ATK and XTENTH-CAR. (B) Examples of small-scale car platforms, categorized into educational platforms and research platforms, including multiple vehicle setups such as ORAC, ICAT, UDSSC and MCCT.*
